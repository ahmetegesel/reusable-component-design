# reusable-component-design

## Purpose
Main idea is to find out a design implementation that is highly-reusable, based on a set of rules and standards, and non-side-effect. Also, it should be able to take care of events and communications between components independently, which means, any of the components should never share any logic itself with any component unnecessarily. Last but not least, components should implement as less amount of logic as possible to keep component highly maintainable, testable, and more importantly reusable.

## Project setup

```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Run your unit tests
```
npm run test:unit
```

## Roadmap
